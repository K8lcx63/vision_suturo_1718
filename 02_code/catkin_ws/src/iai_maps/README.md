iai_maps
========

The semantic and ground lab and environment maps for projects in the IAI group in the University of Bremen.

The maps have been split into several packages:

* iai_maps: 2D maps for localization -> formerly subfolders 'maps', 'launch'
* iai_kitchen_defs: URDF model of the kitchen -> formerly subfolders 'defs', 'room', 'Media'
* iai_semantic_map: Semantic OWL map of the kitchen -> formerly subfolders 'prolog', 'owl'

For those who recently switched from the rosbuild version of iai_maps to the catkinized version,
